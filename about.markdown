I'm Senior Scala Developer interested mainly in functional languages like Haskell and Scala as well as
a branch of mathematics called Category Theory.

I also like streaming systems and fast data systems.

Apart from Programming I really like enduro bikes and love mountains.


This page was created because I thought it would be nice to have my learning path stored in one place.
Maybe it will help someone else to learn Functional Programming or will show that FP is not so hard to learn.
